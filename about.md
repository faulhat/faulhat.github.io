My main interests are systems programming, compilers, and mathematical computing. I also have a longstanding interest in cryptography, specifically in the architecture of symmetric block ciphers such as Rijndael/AES and Bruce Schneier's Feistel network ciphers.

Outside of computing, I'm also interested in chess, linguistics, history, and pure math.
