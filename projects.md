#### Project: Riemann (Active)

Riemann is a graphing program with some analysis capabilities. I'm still actively developing it. User-provided expressions are just-in-time compiled into real subroutines using the [asmjit](https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit/) library, so that they can be computed for many, many values of _x_ very quickly. The graphics are done using GTK.

My plans for the project going forward are to add support for graphing multiple functions at once, to add Monte Carlo area approximation, and to add automatic root finding/equation solving.

#### Project: _Bullet Heaven!_ (Complete)

_Bullet Heaven!_ is a bullet hell game (get it? :P ) that I created for my IB CS class's end-of-year game jam in 12th grade over the course of about ten days.

You can watch me play through the game here:

#### Project: tomc (Abandoned)

tomc was my attempt at a C compiler. I lost interest in it before building in any actual compilation functionality, but it can still make cool graphical representations of C programs.

#### Project: asm-experiments (Active?)

This is just a collection of small assembly programs I wrote for fun. I plan to add to it whenever inspiration strikes.

#### Project: particles (Complete)

particles is a very simple visualization of the particle swarm optimization algorithm written in TypeScript. It picks a random cubic polynomial, adds some random noise to it, and then uses PSO to try to approximate it.
